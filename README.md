** ARMS**
Autonomous Resource Management System for Crisis Survival
Problem Statement:
In space missions, astronauts face critical challenges such as resource scarcity, equipment malfunctions, and health emergencies. These issues can lead to life-threatening situations if not managed promptly and effectively. 
Similarly, during terrestrial disasters like earthquakes, hurricanes, or pandemics, communities often encounter sudden resource shortages and health crises, necessitating efficient management and rapid response to ensure survival.


Our Solution:-
Introducing ARMS (Autonomous Resource Management System), an AI Agent designed to autonomously track, analyze, and optimize survival resources. 
It continuously monitors oxygen levels, food supplies, power availability, communication signals, and astronaut health data (heart rate, oxygen saturation, stress indicators). Using machine learning-driven predictive analytics, ARMS calculates the estimated survival time based on resource consumption rates and physiological conditions.
When survival estimates fall below a safe threshold, ARMS proactively triggers automated alerts to mission control or local response teams, enabling rapid interventions. This AI-driven approach ensures real-time situational awareness, minimizing risks and optimizing life support strategies.
